# njhale's dotfiles

My config. Inspired by [jzelinskie's dotfiles](https://github.com/jzelinskie/dotfiles/blob/master/README.md). 

## Installation 

The installation script symlinks files like `$Home/.dotfiles/.$FILE` to `$HOME/.$FILE`. Plugins used for vim and zsh should be installed automatically (thanks to vim-plug and zplug).
